# Neural Network Python Project - Handwritten Digit Recognition
Used Tensorflow to build a neural network, which is used to recognize images of handwritten digits.

## MNIST dataset
MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) set contains a collection of 70,000, 28 x 28 images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9. 
The dataset is divided into training and testing sets.
